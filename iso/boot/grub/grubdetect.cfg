# This script searches for grub core.img files and presents a menu for the user
# to choose between them, then loads their choice via the multiboot protocol.
# Since we're loading grub's core.img from the filesystem rather than
# chainloading a boot sector this works very reliably, even after grub's
# boot sector has been clobbered by something like the Windows installer.

# Multiboot is only for BIOS based systems, and so this is one of the few
# Super GRUB2 Disk scripts which will only work on BIOS based systems.
